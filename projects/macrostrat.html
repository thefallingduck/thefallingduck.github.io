		  <p class="text-justify"> For over 100 years, geoscientists have appreciated that 
		  Earth's climate and surface chemistry is mediated by mass exchange with the lithosphere. 
		  Due to the challenges 
		  of direct quantification of geological mass fluxes, especially at fine temporal scales, geochemical proxy studies of
		  well-constrained stratigraphic sections have emerged as a dominant mode to study ancient climate and biogeochemical 
		  cycling. My <a href="/projects/ict.html">Ph.D. research</a> was premised certainly on this approach. However, as the number of 
		  active geoscientists grows, and analytical approaches make the generation of large datasets more routine, the ability to 
		  discover and analyze all data relevant to a given question has become unwieldy, but increasingly important for testing 
		  the most pressing questions in Earth history. For example, the canonical model used to interpret carbon isotopic records 
		  contends that there are of two important modes of carbon burial: (1) <b>organic matter</b> and (2) <b>marine carbonate</b>. Recent work 
		  has challenged this paradigm by suggesting that  <b>authigenic carbonate</b>, precipitated from carbon released during anaerobic 
		  organic matter degradation, may be an important third sink for carbon. If correct, our understanding of the carbon cycle 
		  and global redox budgets needs to be redressed at a fundamental level. Testing this model is challenging, however, because 
		  authigenic carbonate can be disseminated over a large volume of buried sediment.</p>
		  
		  <p class="text-justify"><b>Thus, rather than viewing geochemical proxies as replacements for empirical quantification of geological mass 
		  fluxes, these approaches are necessarily complementary.</b>  This 
		  challenge (and opportunity) has led me to work with  <a href="http://macrostrat.org/" target="_blank">Macrostrat</a>, a geospatial 
		  database that describes the age and properties of rocks in the upper crust. In collaboration with  <a href="http://strata.geology.wisc.edu/Home/" target="_blank">Shanan Peters</a>, and
		  using Macrostrat as a framework for <b>geological data synthesis</b>, we can model sedimentary mass fluxes into and out of the lithosphere on geological timescales, and thus 
		  explore the attendant implications for climate and biogeochemical cycles. At its root, the most basic calculation that can be derived from Macrostrat
		  is <b>rock coverage</b> - for a given point in time at a given region in space, does rock exist? The movie above displays this quantity, progressing from 1000 million years ago until today 
		  with polygons color-coded by their dominant lithology. Watch and you will observe a pronounced increase in sedimentary abundance starting at ~500 Ma. This increase is profound and unexpected, and we explore
		  its implications below.</p>

          <h3 align="center">The sedimentary shell as agent of atmospheric oxygenation?</h3>
		  <img src="../img/pO2.png" alt="po2" style="width: 70%; float: left; margin: 0px 15px 5px 0px;">
		  <p class="text-justify">The figure at left is a time series of the animated data from above. The number of Macrostrat columns that have sediments or metasediments 
		  are tabulated for each one million year increment. The sediment coverage record <b>(left axis on figure)</b> is then built by normalizing the time series to the maximum value (i.e., a value of 1 would indicate all of Laurentia 
		  is accumulating sediment at a given time point). Sedimentary and metasedimentary rock coverage
		  is low in the Archean, rises to a higher value in the Proterozoic, and then again rises dramatically during the early Phanerozoic. It is notable that exponential decay in surviving 
		  rock quantity with increasing age, as expected by models of rock cycling, is not apparent in this empirical rock 
		  quantity-age data. By contrast, this time series of North American continental sediment abundance is strikingly similar to the global history of atmospheric oxygen concentration 
		  and major transitions in the global fossil record <b>(right axis on figure)</b>. These empirical results, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2016.12.012" target="_blank">recently published</a>, form the basis for a 
		  simple forward model of net organic carbon burial and oxidative weathering of the crust, which predicts two significant rises in <i>p</i>O<sub>2</sub> separated by three comparatively stable plateaus. 
		  These observations suggest that the two-phased oxygenation of Earth's surface environment, and the long delays between the origin of life, the evolution of metazoans, and their subsequent diversification during the 
		  Cambrian Explosion, was caused by step-wise shifts in the ability of the continents to accumulate and store sedimentary organic carbon. The geodynamic mechanisms that promote and inhibit 
		  sediment accumulation on continental crust have, therefore, exerted a first-order control on the evolution of Earth's life and environment.</p>
