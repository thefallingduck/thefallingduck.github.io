          Understanding the extreme carbon isotope excursions of the Ediacaran Period 
          (635-541 Ma), where &#948<sup>13</sup>C of marine carbonates (&#948<sup>13</sup>C<sub>carb</sub>) reach
         their minimum (-12&#8240) for Earth history, is one of the most vexing problems in Precambrian geology. 
         Known colloquially as the 'Wonoka-Shuram' excursion, the event has been interpreted by many as a product of a 
         profoundly different Ediacaran carbon cycle. More recently, diagenetic processes have been invoked, with 
         the very negative &#948<sup>13</sup>C values of Ediacaran carbonates explained via meteoric alteration, 
         late-stage burial diagenesis or growth of authigenic carbonates in sediments, thus challenging 
         models which rely upon a dramatically changing redox state of the Ediacaran oceans. As part of my Ph.D. work with 
         <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/geosciences/people/maloof/" target="_blank">Adam Maloof</a>, 
         <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/geosciences/people/schoene/" target="_blank">Blair Schoene</a> and Princeton undergraduate ('13) 
         <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~ccy/" target="_blank">Christine Chen</a>, I worked in South Australia
         to study the Edicaran-aged Wonoka Formation. In the southern portions
         of the basin, the Wonoka is ~700 meters of mixed shelf limestones and siliciclastics that record a 17&#8240 &#948<sup>13</sup>C excursion
         (-12 to +5&#8240). Further north, the Wonoka is host to deep (~1 km) paleocanyons (<b>figure right; general dip direction to the east</b>), which are partly filled by 
         tabular-clast carbonate breccias. This preserved canyon-shoulder to canyon-fill depositional system is rare in the rock record, and allows for unique insights 
         into Ediacaran carbon isotope systematics.

          <p class="text-justify"> 
			In paleomagnetics, a conglomerate test is used to determine whether clasts in a conglomerate were magnetized prior to transport and deposition (preserving 
			random magnetic directions) or after deposition (preserving uniform magnetic directions, despite random clast orientations). Analogously, we performed an 
			<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3121.2012.01067.x" target="_blank">isotope conglomerate test</a> on the breccia units of the Wonoka paleocanyons (<b>figure left</b>) to assess the provenance 
			and relative timing of acquisition of &#948<sup>13</sup>C  by measuring the isotopic values of limesone and dolostone clasts. The clasts are sourced from eroded and redeposited horizons from 
			southern canyon-shoulder stratigraphy. Breccia units range from 0.2 to 11 m thick, are clast-supported in a matrix of fine sand, and are most common at the base of the canyon-fill stratigraphy. Within single 
			flows, &#948<sup>13</sup>C of individual clasts can vary between <font color="blue">-12&#8240</font> to <font color="red">+5&#8240</font> (color bar on <b>figure left</b>), the same range observed in intact
			canyon-shoulder sections. These results require that the negative &#948<sup>13</sup>C values were acquired in Wonoka carbonates <em>before</em> those carbonates were brecciated and redeposited into 
			the paleocanyons, and could not be a result of late-stage burial diagenesis

			These isotope conglomerate tests (<b>figure above</b>) preclude a burial diagenesis model for the origin of the extremely negative &#948<sup>13</sup>C
			values in South Australia, but what about  about styles of diagenesis which may have occurred earlier? An excellent place to start with this question is the sedimentology, and there is indeed textual evidence 
			that supports early diagenesis (<b>figure right</b>). Pictured here is a high-contrast, black and white image of a polished slab of Wonoka grainstone, oriented so that up is the paleo-up direction. At the base, 
			there are well preserved, flat laminae, but this primary texture is lost towards the top of the bed, with replacement by a secondary texture called <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2475/01.2015.01" target="_blank">stylonodular bedding</a>, 
			with nodule size increasing towards the top. The texture is interpreted to have formed <b>early</b>, most likely during sedimentary hiatuses between the deposition of event beds. Attendent with this 
			physical transformation is a 0.5&#8240 drop in &#948<sup>13</sup>C values and rises in concentrations of manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe). Thus, while Wonoka carbonates do contain a record of syn-depositional diagenesis,
			the scale of the signal is small (<0.5 to 1&#8240) cannot be used to explain the full 17&#8240 excursion observed in the Ediacaran Wonoka Formation.
